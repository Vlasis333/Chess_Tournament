# Chess_Tournament

We need to create a Chess tournament
This chess tournament has the following rules
  1. we dont know how many players we apply to the tournament
  2. each player needs to play 3 games
  3. the games last for 3 minutes
    the application needs to randomly create games for each player with a diffrent opponent 
    every time 
  4. each player plays a move (we dont care about the specifics of the move)
  5. when the 3 minutes time frame expires the game must declare a winner (Player 1 or Player 2) Randomly
  6. when all the games are finished we need to show the winners
  7. each winner gets 3 points for each win
